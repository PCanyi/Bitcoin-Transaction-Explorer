README: Bitcoin Transaction Explorer
==============================================================
This is an application built on top of the Java Play Framework
(http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.2/home).

Bitcoin Transaction Explorer queries information from 
http://blockexplorer.com and present it in a graphical manner
where transactions are "first class citizens". This allows you
to track the input of a transaction all the way 
back to the transaction that generated the bitcoins. The main
aim is to be able to track the flow of coins from generation to
current status.

This application will be hosted at http://btc.xqoob.com soon.

Disclaimer: This application provides no guarantees as to it's
accuracy, and makes no claims on whether it is fit-for-purpose
